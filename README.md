### Running the Project

Ensure you have **Python 3.7 or higher** installed. You'll also need the latest version of the **TCOD** library. Follow the instructions [here](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to install it.

Once everything is set up, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py

**Note: ** This project is currently under development. I am actively working on fixing bugs and adding new features.
